# TEDxKMITL

TEDxKMITL is an independently organized TEDx event by KMITL students and personel. Our main concept and theme of our event is “Living Out Loud” or LOL which is to bring out the speakers and audiences full potential to show their inner self, what they truly have in them but doesn’t come out very often. Every person has a part in their life that they keep in secret, now is the time to get up and jump out into society. Live the moment, enjoy the life.

# The Website

TEDxKMITL website is the hub where most of the event's systems rely on. We have a registration system, a mailing system, an in-event social playground, an audience selection system and so many more. These back-end systems are powered by Laravel.

For the front-end side, we are using Foundation 6 framework with some new Web technologies like HTML5's `picture` tag, which is used along with `srcset` for choosing the photos that are appropriate for each pixel density. With all the optimizations we have done, the website scores 97 points in PageSpeed test.
